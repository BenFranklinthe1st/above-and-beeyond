    <p>
      Nowadays, parents are really busy with work and it's much harder for them to spend time with their children.
      As a result, many kids don't have the resources they need for school and life.
  This website allows students to find out about local events,
  certificates, opportunities, and much more resources
  that will make them world ready.

  This is a list of resources that I have found online, most of them are totally free!
  This list contains some of what I believe are good and reliable, but it misses a lot.
  If you have any suggestions for any of the subjects please contact me.

      Books are a great way to learn lesson and are by far the best resources.
      It's by far the best investment, your are paying around 30$ for ideas that could change your entire perception of the world.
      Here is a list of books that I've read and plan to read.

          <p>
        Here is a list of goals that I am currently working on in order to grow and improve.
        I recommend you to create your own list, be reasonable and use the S.M.A.R.T. goal as a guideline.
        Don't let yourself down if you aren't able to achieve it, the struggle is part of the process.
        Trust the process it's waht makes you better not the reward.
